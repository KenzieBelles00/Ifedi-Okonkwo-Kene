<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Mix dry ingredients: In a bowl, sift together the flour and the sugar. This ensures the batter is light and lump-free.</li>
  <li>Combine wet ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk the egg with the milk.</li>
  <li>Make the batter: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently mix until just combined. The batter should be slightly lumpy. Do not overmix because it can make pancakes tough.</li>
  <li>Heat the pan: Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Lightly grease with your veg oil.</li>
  <li>Cook the pancakes: Pour a small spoon of batter onto the pan for each pancake. Cook for about 2–3 minutes. Flip carefully and cook for another 1–2 minutes until golden brown on both sides.</li>
  <li>Serve: Stack the pancakes on a plate and serve warm. Popular toppings include maple syrup or a sprinkle of powdered sugar. I usually just add nothing.</li>
</ol>
<p>And just like that, you've made yourself some delicious pancakes. Serve with any drink of your choice on the side and enjoy your meal!</p>
